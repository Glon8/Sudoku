# Sudoku

My code for Sudoku in console, wrote on Java, the work stuck and stopped due a heavy logical issue or lack of mathematical knowledge.

**Activation:** The code activated by Main file.

The Grid, creates the visual charts and referenses, while Gene, Fills the charts with "Correct" Sudoku pattern.

**Error:** As the code reaches last few digits in generation: 6,7,8,9.
The generation logic somewhat breaks, and requires change in math or more complex "mechanical" solution.
